# Turing Infrastructure Drop-in Sessions

The Turing Infrastructure Drop-in sessions are currently led by three teams:
- [Data Wrangling Team](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/data-for-research)
- [Research Engineering Group (REG)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/research/research-engineering-group)
- [Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems)

These teams hold regular, informal, community-led sessions for students and researchers. Whether you have general questions on a topic, or are seeking specific technical guidance on, or just want to chat with friendly faces, our drop-in session is the perfect place for you! The sessions offer a friendly, welcoming, non-judgemental environment to receive advice or assistance without concern about being judged on technical knowledge, expertise or understanding. For examples of what we may be able to help with see our [wiki](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/infrastructure-drop-ins/wiki) 🧐

Even if we don't have an immediate answer for you in the session, fear not! Our teams are well-connected and consists of a diverse range of Research Software Engineers (RSEs), Research Data Scientists (RDSs), Research Application Managers (RAMs), Research Community Managers (RCMs) and Data Wranglers with each member having a unique set of skills and expertise. We can seamlessly put you in touch with other members in our teams, or researchers we have worked with so you can have a chat.

The drop-ins are hybrid: depending on who is available on each day, we'll be either on Zoom (you can find the link on Mathison) or in the office in the kitchen area on the 1st floor.
