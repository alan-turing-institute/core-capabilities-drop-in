# Turing Core Capabilities Drop-in Sessions

The Core-Capabilities-Drop-in sessions are led by three teams:
- [Data Wrangling Team](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/data-for-research)
- [Research Engineering Group (REG)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/research/research-engineering-group)
- [Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems)

These teams hold regular, informal, community-led sessions for students and researchers. Whether you have general questions on a topic, or are seeking specific technical guidance on, or just want to chat with friendly faces, our drop-in session is the perfect place for you! The sessions offer a friendly, welcoming, non-judgemental environment to receive advice or assistance without concern about being judged on technical knowledge, expertise or understanding.

Even if we don't have an immediate answer for you in the session, fear not! Our teams are well-connected and consists of a diverse range of Research Software Engineers (RSEs), Research Data Scientists (RDSs), Research Application Managers (RAMs), Community Managers and Data Wranglers with each member having a unique set of skills and expertise. We can seamlessly put you in touch with other members in our teams, or researchers we have worked with so you can have a chat.

Feel free to message the [organisers](#organisers) ahead of time with your problem on Slack, or just come by! See you at the drop-in session! üöÄ

## Organisers

- [Iain](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/research-engineering/iain-stenson)
    - Iain is a Senior RSE in REG and the Research Computing sub-team.
    - He's particularly interested in helping people to make the most of Azure.
    - He mostly writes in Python but will have a go at any programming language.
    - You might want to get in touch with him if your code runs too slowly or you're looking to automate something on Azure or with GitHub Actions.
- [Fede](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/federico-nanni)
    - Fede is a Senior RDS in REG and the Foundational AI sub-team. Together with Ryan, he organises the [Foundation Models reading group](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/foundation-models-reading-group) at the Turing.
    - He's particularly interested in helping people brainstorming research projects with a data science component (in any domain) and in moving them from initial ideas to implementations.
    - He has a background in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval, with specific focus on their applications in Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science.
- [Ryan](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/research-engineering/ryan-chan)
    - Ryan is an RSE in REG and the Foundational AI sub-team.
    - He mostly writes in Python but has experience with Julia and R too.
    - He's particularly interested in machine learning problems and NLP and runs the [Foundation Models reading group](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/foundation-models-reading-group) at the Turing with Fede.
    - Before joining REG, Ryan completed his PhD in Statistics at Warwick working on Monte Carlo problems and has a background in Mathematics.
